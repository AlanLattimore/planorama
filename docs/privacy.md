I understand that this application is holding personal data that I submitted to Chicon 8, and that unless otherwise noted all personal data held by Chicon 8 will be treated as confidential. It will only be accessible to authorized Chicon staff, and will not be shared outside of Chicon without my consent. I understand that my information will be stored in Chicon’s systems, which will use 3rd party data providers.

Chicon will hold personal data in Planorama no longer than two years after the convention.

Requests to delete data from Planorama should be sent to <a href="mailto:program-data-requests@chicon.org">program-data-requests@chicon.org</a> Please note that after the response to such a request is complete we will retain sufficient information in the system to determine that we previously held your information, and then deleted it at your request on a particular date.  

As a Chicon 8 staff member, I understand that if my account is terminated my user record will be deleted in the same manner as a program participant’s record would be deleted except that some of my Personally Identifiable Information (specifically name and Chicon email address) may be retained in certain records such as program session notes and application log files.

I consent to providing my data to Chicon 8 as described above for the purposes of participating in planning the convention. I agree that Chicon 8 may contact me with questions related to my responses as well as with requests for additional information.
