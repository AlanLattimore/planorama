This conference planning tool is used by Worldcon (and in the future other Science Fiction Conventions) to help them plan conventions. It helps the team collaborate and organize like venues, lists of participants and the conference schedule/programme. It also assists in building the complete schedule and handle potential scheduling and/or room conflicts while you're building it. Planorama also assists with sending emails to prospective speakers, and lets you build surveys to assist in collecting data before, during or after your event.

This software is open source! If you'd like to contribute, please email planorama@chicon.org.
