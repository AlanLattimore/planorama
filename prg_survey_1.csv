Note: This class can be dual live/virtual. Presented live is the plan. It can be adapted to a virtual only class should I be prevented from traveling to Chicon due to some random Covid restriction that thankfully doesn’t currently exist. You should keep one slot of virtual ability free for last minute unable to attends which are extremely likely to occur … but hopefully not me!

Workshop! 10 minute scheduled slots (sign up in advance). This workshop happens AFTER the classes. Was the class over your head? Would you rather have someone do it for you? For free? Have Liz fill in your W8-BEN, W8-BEN-E, ITIN, or SS-4 applications!  (20 min scheduled slot for ITIN applications).
•	Must bring documents with you. If you don’t have the documents, you lose your slot.

External Processing: A discussion of how much of our minds we can place outside ourselves before we stop being us.  Starting with bards  writing down information and no longer needing to remember and pass down stories verbally, ends with us being personalities alone with everything else done by artifice?

UnForgotten: What happens when the right to be forgotten becomes the inability to forget?  When every tree and blade of grass at every moment we experience them is recorded and stored, do we still grow as people or do we become our snapshots?
